# Certificate Repository

This is the central repository for all certificates and credentials I have acquired throughout my professional and learning journey.

## Organization

The certificates are categorized into subdirectories, according to the type of event or program from which they were obtained:

-   **01_Certifications:** Formal certifications, usually obtained after passing an official exam.
-   **02_Formacoes:** Certificates of completion from Professional Qualifications, which are structured programs for a complete skill set.
-   **03_Bootcamps:** Certificates of completion from intensive training programs (bootcamps).
-   **04_Courses:** Certificates of completion from online or in-person courses.
-   **05_Immersions:** Certificates of participation from immersions and hands-on events.
-   **06_Workshops:** Certificates of participation from workshops.

## Naming Convention

All certificate files follow a standard pattern for easy identification:

`[Year]_[Institution]_[Certificate_Name].pdf`
